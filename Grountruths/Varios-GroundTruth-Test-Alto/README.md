# Groundtruths test

In view of determining the best image pre-processing for Kraken OCRed, we set up a series of tests on our Grountruth corpus.
To do this, we performed different treatments on the images of our corpus from a notebook that we wrote for this purpose. All models are created on the same Alto XML files and training sets (more information about the sets [here](https://github.com/DesenrollandoElCordel/Varios-OCR-files/blob/main/README.md#split)), only the images change. 

## Test results
